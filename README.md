# Trending-news-finder
This Python script allows a user to get trending news by either RSS or by specifying an xpath on a website. It also shows the top trends in Google.
Put the feeds you want -- either RSS, or websites with xpaths, in the URL section. Note that if you're adding an RSS, you have to add None afterwards, so that it knows not to look for an xpath.
